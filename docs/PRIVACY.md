# Privacy Policy

## Local-First Philosophy

stick.ai is designed with a **local-first architecture**. This means:

- **No cloud transmission** unless you explicitly enable cloud features
- **Complete data sovereignty** - you own and control all agent data
- **Zero tracking** of your agent interactions in local mode

## Information We Collect
